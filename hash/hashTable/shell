       yum - redirecting to DNF Command Reference

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [1mdnf [options] <command> [<args>...][0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mDNF[24m  is  the  next  upcoming  major version of [4mYUM[24m, a package manager for RPM-based Linux distributions. It roughly
       maintains CLI compatibility with YUM and defines a strict API for extensions and plugins.

       Plugins can modify or extend features of DNF or provide additional CLI commands on top of those mentioned below. If
       you  know  the  name of such a command (including commands mentioned below), you may find/install the package which
       provides it using the appropriate virtual provide in the form of [1mdnf-command(<alias>)[22m, where [1m<alias> [22mis the name of
       the  command;  e.g.``dnf  install  'dnf-command(versionlock)'``  installs  a [1mversionlock [22mplugin. This approach also
       applies to specifying dependencies of packages that require a particular DNF command.

       Return values:

       · [1m0  [22m: Operation was successful.

       · [1m1  [22m: An error occurred, which was handled by dnf.

       · [1m3  [22m: An unknown unhandled error occurred during operation.

       · [1m100[22m: See [4mcheck-update[0m

              query, updateinfo and upgrade commands.

       [1m--allowerasing[0m
              Allow  erasing of installed packages to resolve dependencies. This option could be used as an alternative to
              the [1myum swap [22mcommand where packages to remove are not explicitly defined.

       [1m--assumeno[0m
              Automatically answer no for all questions.

       [1m-b, --best[0m
              Try the best available package versions in transactions. Specifically during [4mdnf[24m [4mupgrade[24m, which  by  default
              skips  over updates that can not be installed for dependency reasons, the switch forces DNF to only consider
              the latest packages. When running into packages with broken dependencies, DNF will fail giving a reason  why
              the latest version can not be installed.

       [1m--bugfix[0m
              Include packages that fix a bugfix issue. Applicable for the install, repoquery, updateinfo and upgrade com‐
              mands.

              Include packages that fix a Bugzilla ID, Eg. 123123. Applicable for the install, repoquery,  updateinfo  and
              upgrade commands.

       [1m-C, --cacheonly[0m
              Run entirely from system cache, don't update the cache and use it even in case it is expired.

              DNF  uses  a separate cache for each user under which it executes. The cache for the root user is called the
              system cache. This switch allows a regular user read-only access to the system cache, which usually is  more
              fresh than the user's and thus he does not have to wait for metadata sync.

       [1m--forcearch=<arch>[0m
              Force the use of an architecture. Any architecture can be specified.  However, use of  an  architecture  not
              supported natively by your CPU will require emulation of some kind. This is usually through QEMU. The behav‐
              ior of [1m--forcearch [22mcan be configured by using the arch and  ignorearch  configuration  options  with  values
              [1m<arch> [22mand [1mTrue [22mrespectively.

       [1m-h, --help, --help-cmd[0m
              Show the help.

       [1m--installroot=<path>[0m
              Specifies  an  alternative installroot, relative to where all packages will be installed. Think of this like
              doing [1mchroot <root> dnf[22m, except using [1m--installroot [22mallows dnf to work before  the  chroot  is  created.  It
              requires absolute path.

       · [4mcachedir[24m,  [4mlog[24m  [4mfiles[24m,  [4mreleasever[24m,  and [4mgpgkey[24m are taken from or stored in the installroot. [4mGpgkeys[24m are imported
         into the installroot from a path relative to the host which can be specified in the repository section of config‐
         uration files.

       · [4mconfiguration[24m  [4mfile[24m  and  reposdir  are  searched inside the installroot first. If they are not present, they are
         taken from the host system.  Note:  When a path is specified within a  command  line  argument  ([1m--config=<config[0m
         [1mfile> [22min case of [4mconfiguration[24m [4mfile[24m and [1m--setopt=reposdir=<reposdir> [22mfor [4mreposdir[24m) then this path is always rela‐
         tive to the host with no exceptions.

       · The [4mpluginpath[24m and [4mpluginconfpath[24m are relative to the host.
          Note: You may also want to use the command-line option [1m--releasever=<release>  [22mwhen  creating  the  installroot,
          otherwise the [4m$releasever[24m value is taken from the rpmdb within the installroot (and thus it is empty at the time
          of creation and the transaction will fail). If [1m--releasever=/ [22mis used, the releasever will be detected from  the
          host  ([1m/[22m)  system.  The new installroot path at the time of creation does not contain the [4mrepository[24m, [4mreleasever[0m
          and [4mdnf.conf[24m files.

          On a modular system you may also want to use the [1m--setopt=module_platform_id=<module_platform_name:stream>  [22mcom‐
          mand-line  option  when  creating the installroot, otherwise the module_platform_id value will be taken from the
          [1m/etc/os-release [22mfile within the installroot (and thus it will be empty at the  time  of  creation,  the  modular
          dependency could be unsatisfied and modules content could be excluded).

          Installroot examples:

          [1mdnf --installroot=<installroot> --releasever=<release> install system-release[0m
                 Permanently sets the [1mreleasever [22mof the system in the [1m<installroot> [22mdirectory to [1m<release>[22m.

          [1mdnf --installroot=<installroot> --setopt=reposdir=<path> --config /path/dnf.conf upgrade[0m

              ration files and mirrorlist URLs.

       [1m--repofrompath <repo>,<path/url>[0m
              Specify a path or url to a repository (same path as in a baseurl) to add to the repositories for this query.
              This  option  can be used multiple times. The repository label for the repository is specified by <repo>. If
              you want to view only packages  from  this  repository,  combine  this  with  the  [1m--repo=<repo>  [22mor  [1m--dis‐[0m

       To  use  an alias (name=value), the name must be placed as the first "command" (e.g. the first argument that is not
       an option). It is then replaced by its value and the resulting sequence is again searched for  aliases.  The  alias
       processing stops when the first found command is not a name of any alias.

       Also, like in shell aliases, if the result starts with a [1m\[22m, the alias processing will stop.

       All  aliases  are defined in configuration files in the [1m/etc/dnf/aliases.d/ [22mdirectory in the [aliases] section, and
       aliases created by the alias command are written to the [1mUSER.conf [22mfile.  Optionally, there is the [1menabled [22moption in
       the  [1m[main] [22msection defaulting to True. This can be set for each file separately in the respective file, or globaly
       for all aliases in the [1mALIASES.conf [22mfile.

       [1mdnf alias [options] [list] [<name>...][0m
          List aliases with their final result. The [1m[<alias>...] [22mparameter further limits the result to only those aliases
          matching it.

       [1mdnf alias [options] add <name=value>...[0m
          Create new aliases.

       [1mdnf alias [options] delete <name>...[0m
          Delete aliases.

   [1mAuto Remove Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] autoremove[0m
          Removes all "leaf" packages from the system that were originally installed  as  dependencies  of  user-installed
          packages, but which are no longer required by any such package.

       Packages listed in installonlypkgs are never automatically removed by this command.

       [1mdnf [options] autoremove <spec>...[0m
          This  is  an  alias for the [4mRemove[24m [4mCommand[24m command with clean_requirements_on_remove set to [1mTrue[22m. It removes the
          specified packages from the system along with any packages depending on the packages being removed. Each  [1m<spec>[0m
          can  be  either  a  [1m<package-spec>[22m,  which  specifies a package directly, or a [1m@<group-spec>[22m, which specifies an
          (environment) group which contains it. It also removes any dependencies that are no longer needed.

          There are also a few specific autoremove commands [1mautoremove-n[22m, [1mautoremove-na [22mand  [1mautoremove-nevra  [22mthat  allow
          the specification of an exact argument in the NEVRA (name-epoch:version-release.architecture) format.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata. See also [4mMetadata[24m [4mSynchronization[24m.

   [1mCheck Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] check [--dependencies] [--duplicates] [--obsoleted] [--provides][0m
          Checks  the  local  packagedb  and produces information on any problems it finds. You can limit the checks to be
          performed by using the [1m--dependencies[22m, [1m--duplicates[22m, [1m--obsoleted [22mand [1m--provides [22moptions (the default is to check
          everything).

   [1mCheck-Update Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] check-update [--changelogs] [<package-specs>...][0m
          Non-interactively  checks  if  updates of the specified packages are available. If no [1m<package-specs> [22mare given,
          checks whether any updates at all are available for your system. DNF exit  code  will  be  100  when  there  are
          updates  available and a list of the updates will be printed, 0 if not and 1 if an error occurs. If [1m--changelogs[0m
          option is specified, also changelog delta of packages about to be updated is printed.

          Please note that having  a  specific  newer  version  available  for  an  installed  package  (and  reported  by
          [1mcheck-update[22m) does not imply that subsequent [1mdnf upgrade [22mwill install it. The difference is that [1mdnf upgrade [22mhas
          restrictions (like package dependencies being satisfied) to take into account.

          The output is affected by the autocheck_running_kernel configuration option.

   [1mClean Command[0m
       Performs cleanup of temporary files kept for repositories. This includes any such data left behind from disabled or
       removed repositories as well as for different distribution release versions.

       [1mdnf clean dbcache[0m
              Removes  cache  files  generated from the repository metadata. This forces DNF to regenerate the cache files
              the next time it is run.

       [1mdnf clean expire-cache[0m
              Marks the repository metadata expired. DNF will re-validate the cache for each repository the next  time  it
              is used.

       [1mdnf clean metadata[0m
              Removes  repository  metadata.  Those  are  the files which DNF uses to determine the remote availability of
              packages. Using this option will make DNF download all the metadata the next time it is run.

       [1mdnf clean packages[0m
              Removes any cached packages from the system.

       [1mdnf clean all[0m
              Does all of the above.

   [1mDistro-Sync command[0m

   [1mGroup Command[0m
       Groups  are  virtual collections of packages. DNF keeps track of groups that the user selected ("marked") installed
       and can manipulate the comprising packages with simple commands.

       [1mdnf [options] group [summary] <group-spec>[0m
              Display overview of how many groups are installed and available. With a spec, limit the output to the match‐
              ing groups. [1msummary [22mis the default groups subcommand.

       [1mdnf [options] group info <group-spec>[0m
              Display  package lists of a group. Shows which packages are installed or available from a repository when [1m-v[0m
              is used.

       [1mdnf [options] group install [--with-optional] <group-spec>...[0m
              Mark the specified group installed and install packages it contains. Also include [4moptional[24m packages  of  the
              group  if [1m--with-optional [22mis specified. All [4mmandatory[24m and [4mDefault[24m packages will be installed whenever possi‐
              ble.  Conditional packages are installed if they meet their requirement.  If  the  group  is  already  (par‐
              tially) installed, the command installs the missing packages from the group.

       [1mdnf [options] group list <group-spec>...[0m
              List  all  matching  groups,  either  among installed or available groups. If nothing is specified, list all
              known groups. [1m--installed [22mand [1m--available [22moptions narrow down the requested list.  Records  are  ordered  by
              the  [4mdisplay_order[24m  tag  defined  in  comps.xml  file.  Provides a list of all hidden groups by using option
              [1m--hidden[22m.  Provides more detailed information when the [1m-v [22moption is used.

       [1mdnf [options] group remove <group-spec>...[0m
              Mark the group removed and remove those packages in the group from the system which do not belong to another
              installed group and were not installed explicitly by the user.

       [1mdnf [options] group upgrade <group-spec>...[0m
              Upgrades the packages from the group and upgrades the group itself. The latter comprises of installing pack‐
              ages that were added to the group by the distribution and removing packages that got removed from the  group
              as far as they were not installed explicitly by the user.

       Groups can also be marked installed or removed without physically manipulating any packages:

       [1mdnf [options] group mark install <group-spec>...[0m
              Mark  the  specified  group  installed. No packages will be installed by this command, but the group is then
              considered installed.

       [1mdnf [options] group mark remove <group-spec>...[0m
              Mark the specified group removed. No packages will be removed by this command.

   [1mHelp Command[0m
       [1mdnf help [<command>][0m
              Displays the help text for all commands. If given a command name then only displays help for that particular
              command.

   [1mHistory Command[0m
       The history command allows the user to view what has happened in past transactions and act according to this infor‐
       mation (assuming the [1mhistory_record [22mconfiguration option is set).

       [1mdnf history [list] [<spec>...][0m
              The default history action is listing information about given transactions in a table. Each  [1m<spec>  [22mcan  be
              either  a  [1m<transaction-spec>[22m,  which  specifies  a transaction directly, or a [1m<transaction-spec>..<transac‐[0m
              [1mtion-spec>[22m, which specifies a range of transactions, or a [1m<package-name-spec>[22m, which specifies a transaction
              by a package which it manipulated. When no transaction is specified, list all known transactions.

       [1mdnf history info [<spec>...][0m
              Describe  the  given transactions. The meaning of [1m<spec> [22mis the same as in the [4mHistory[24m [4mList[24m [4mCommand[24m. When no
              transaction is specified, describe what happened during the latest transaction.

       [1mdnf history redo <transaction-spec>|<package-name-spec>[0m
              Repeat the specified transaction. Uses the last transaction (with the highest ID) if more than one  transac‐
              tion  for  given <package-name-spec> is found. If it is not possible to redo some operations due to the cur‐
              rent state of RPMDB, it will not redo the transaction.

       [1mdnf history rollback <transaction-spec>|<package-name-spec>[0m
              Undo all transactions performed after the specified transaction. Uses the last transaction (with the highest
              ID) if more than one transaction for given <package-name-spec> is found.  If it is not possible to undo some
              transactions due to the current state of RPMDB, it will not undo any transaction.

       [1mdnf history undo <transaction-spec>|<package-name-spec>[0m
              Perform the opposite operation to all operations performed in the  specified  transaction.   Uses  the  last
              transaction (with the highest ID) if more than one transaction for given <package-name-spec> is found. If it
              is not possible to undo some operations due to the current state of RPMDB, it will not undo the transaction.

       [1mdnf history userinstalled[0m
              Show all installonly packages, packages installed outside of DNF and packages not installed  as  dependency.
              I.e.  it  lists  packages that will stay on the system when [4mAuto[24m [4mRemove[24m [4mCommand[24m or [4mRemove[24m [4mCommand[24m along with
              [4mclean_requirements_on_remove[24m configuration option set to True is executed. Note  the  same  results  can  be
              accomplished with [1mdnf repoquery --userinstalled[22m, and the repoquery command is more powerful in formatting of
              the output.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata, except for the redo, rollback, and undo  subcom‐
       mands.  See also [4mMetadata[24m [4mSynchronization[24m and [4mConfiguration[24m [4mFiles[24m [4mReplacement[24m [4mPolicy[24m.

   [1mInfo Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] info [<package-name-spec>...][0m
              Lists description and summary information about installed and available packages.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata. See also [4mMetadata[24m [4mSynchronization[24m.

   [1mInstall Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] install <spec>...[0m
              Makes  sure  that  the given packages and their dependencies are installed on the system. Each [1m<spec> [22mcan be
              either a [4m<package-spec>[24m, or a @[4m<module-spec>[24m, or a @[4m<group-spec>[24m.  See [4mInstall[24m [4mExamples[24m.  If a given package
              or  provide cannot be (and is not already) installed, the exit code will be non-zero.  If the [1m<spec> [22mmatches
              both a @[4m<module-spec>[24m and a @[4m<group-spec>[24m, only the module is installed.

              When [4m<package-spec>[24m to specify the exact version of the package is given, DNF will install the desired  ver‐
              sion, no matter which version of the package is already installed. The former version of the package will be
              removed in the case of non-installonly package.

              There are also a few specific install commands [1minstall-n[22m, [1minstall-na [22mand [1minstall-nevra [22mthat allow the speci‐
              fication of an exact argument in the NEVRA format.

   [1mInstall Examples[0m
       [1mdnf install tito[0m
              Install the [1mtito [22mpackage (tito is the package name).

       [1mdnf install ~/Downloads/tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm[0m
              Install a local rpm file tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm from the ~/Downloads/ directory.

       [1mdnf install tito-0.5.6-1.fc22[0m
              Install  the  package with a specific version. If the package is already installed it will automatically try
              to downgrade or upgrade to the specific version.

       [1mdnf --best install tito[0m
              Install the latest available version of the package. If the package is already  installed  it  will  try  to
              automatically  upgrade  to the latest version. If the latest version of the package cannot be installed, the
              installation will fail.

       [1mdnf install vim[0m
              DNF will automatically recognize that vim is not a package name, but will look up and install a package that
              provides  vim  with all the required dependencies. Note: Package name match has precedence over package pro‐
              vides match.

       [1mdnf install https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/tito/0.6.0/1.fc22/noarch/tito-0.6.0-1.fc22.noarch.rpm[0m

       [1mdnf install /usr/bin/rpmsign[0m
              Install a package that provides the /usr/bin/rpmsign file.

       [1mdnf -y install tito --setopt=install_weak_deps=False[0m
              Install the [1mtito [22mpackage (tito is the package name) without weak deps. Weak deps are not required  for  core
              functionality  of  the package, but they enhance the original package (like extended documentation, plugins,
              additional functions, etc.).

       [1mdnf install --advisory=FEDORA-2018-b7b99fe852 \*[0m
              Install all packages that belong to the "FEDORA-2018-b7b99fe852" advisory.

   [1mList Command[0m
       Prints lists of packages depending on the packages' relation to the system. A package is [1minstalled [22mif it is present
       in  the RPMDB, and it is [1mavailable [22mif it is not installed but is present in a repository that DNF knows about.  The
       list command can also limit the displayed packages according to specific criteria, e.g. to only those  that  update
       an  installed  package.  The  exclude  option  in  the  configuration  file can influence the result, but if the -‐
       [4m-disableexcludes[24m command line option is used, it ensures that all installed packages will be listed.

       All the forms take the [1m[<package-specs>...] [22mparameter to further limit the result to only  packages  that  matching
       it.

       [1mdnf [options] list [--all] [<package-name-specs>...][0m

              the local metadata hasn't expired yet or when the metadata timestamp hasn't changed).

       [1mdnf [options] makecache --timer[0m
              Like plain [1mmakecache[22m, but instructs DNF to be more resource-aware, meaning it will not do anything  if  run‐
              ning  on  battery  power and will terminate immediately if it's too soon after the last successful [1mmakecache[0m
              run (see [1mdnf.conf(5)[22m, metadata_timer_sync).

   [1mMark Command[0m
       [1mdnf mark install <package-specs>...[0m
              Marks the specified packages as installed by user. This can be useful if any  package  was  installed  as  a
              dependency  and  is  desired  to  stay  on  the system when [4mAuto[24m [4mRemove[24m [4mCommand[24m or [4mRemove[24m [4mCommand[24m along with

       [1mdnf mark remove <package-specs>...[0m
              Unmarks the specified packages as installed by user. Whenever you as a user don't need  a  specific  package
              you  can mark it for removal. The package stays installed on the system but will be removed when [4mAuto[24m [4mRemove[0m

              requirement of other user installed packages on the system.

       [1mdnf mark group <package-specs>...[0m
              Marks the specified packages as installed by group. This can be useful if any package  was  installed  as  a
              dependency or a user and is desired to be protected and handled as a group member like during group remove.

   [1mModule Command[0m
       Module subcommands take [4m<module-spec>[24m... arguments that specify modules or profiles.

       [1mdnf [options] module install <module-spec>...[0m
              Install  module  profiles,  including their packages.  In case no profile was provided, all default profiles
              get installed.  Module streams get enabled accordingly.

              This command cannot be used for switching module streams. It is recommended to remove all installed  content
              from  the  module  and reset the module using the [4mreset[24m command. After you reset the module, you can install
              the other stream.

       [1mdnf [options] module update <module-spec>...[0m
              Update packages associated with an active module stream, optionally restricted to a profile.   If  the  [4mpro‐[0m
              [4mfile_name[24m is provided, only the packages referenced by that profile will be updated.

       [1mdnf [options] module remove <module-spec>...[0m
              Remove  installed module profiles, including their packages.  In case no profile was provided, all installed
              profiles get removed.

       [1mdnf [options] module enable <module-spec>...[0m
              Enable a module stream and make the stream RPMs available in the package set.

              Modular dependencies are resolved, dependencies checked and also recursively enabled.  In  case  of  modular
              dependency  issue  the  operation  will  be  rejected. To perform the action anyway please use -[4m-skip-broken[0m
              option.

              This command cannot be used for switching module streams. It is recommended to remove all installed  content

   [1mProvides Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] provides <provide-spec>[0m
              Finds the packages providing the given [1m<provide-spec>[22m. This is useful when one knows a filename and wants to
              find what package (installed or not) provides this file.  The [1m<provide-spec> [22mis gradually looked for at fol‐
              lowing locations:

              1. The [1m<provide-spec> [22mis matched with all file provides of any available package:

                    $ dnf provides /usr/bin/gzip
                    gzip-1.9-9.fc29.x86_64 : The GNU data compression program
                    Matched from:
                    Filename    : /usr/bin/gzip

              2. Then all provides of all available packages are searched:

                    $ dnf provides "gzip(x86-64)"
                    gzip-1.9-9.fc29.x86_64 : The GNU data compression program
                    Matched from:
                    Provide     : gzip(x86-64) = 1.9-9.fc29

              3. DNF  assumes that the [1m<provide-spec> [22mis a system command, prepends it with [1m/usr/bin/[22m, [1m/usr/sbin/ [22mprefixes
                 (one at a time) and does the file provides search again. For legacy reasons (packages that didn't do Usr‐
                 Move) also [1m/bin [22mand [1m/sbin [22mprefixes are being searched:

                    $ dnf provides zless
                    gzip-1.9-9.fc29.x86_64 : The GNU data compression program
                    Matched from:
                    Filename    : /usr/bin/zless

              4. If this last step also fails, DNF returns "Error: No Matches found".

              This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata. See also [4mMetadata[24m [4mSynchronization[24m.

   [1mReinstall Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] reinstall <package-specs>...[0m
              Installs  the  specified  packages,  fails if some of the packages are either not installed or not available
              (i.e. there is no repository where to download the same RPM).

   [1mRemove Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] remove <package-specs>...[0m
              Removes the specified packages from the system along with any  packages  depending  on  the  packages  being
              removed. Each [1m<spec> [22mcan be either a [1m<package-spec>[22m, which specifies a package directly, or a [1m@<group-spec>[22m,
              which specifies an (environment) group which contains it. If [1mclean_requirements_on_remove  [22mis  enabled  (the
              default), also removes any dependencies that are no longer needed.

       [1mdnf [options] remove --duplicates[0m
              Removes older version of duplicated packages.

       [1mdnf [options] remove --oldinstallonly[0m
              Removes old installonly packages, keeping only [1minstallonly_limit [22mlatest versions.

              There are also a few specific remove commands [1mremove-n[22m, [1mremove-na [22mand [1mremove-nevra [22mthat allow the specifica‐
              tion of an exact argument in the NEVRA format.

   [1mRemove Examples[0m
       [1mdnf remove acpi tito[0m
              Remove the [1macpi [22mand [1mtito [22mpackages.

       [1mdnf remove $(dnf repoquery --extras --exclude=tito,acpi)[0m
              Remove packages not present in any repository, but don't remove the [1mtito [22mand [1macpi [22mpackages (they still might
              be removed if they depend on some of the removed packages).

       Remove older versions of duplicated packages (an equivalent of yum's [4mpackage-cleanup[24m [4m--cleandups[24m):

          dnf remove --duplicates

   [1mRepoinfo Command[0m
          An alias for the [4mrepolist[24m command that provides more detailed information like [1mdnf repolist -v[22m.

   [1mRepolist Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] repolist [--enabled|--disabled|--all][0m
              Depending  on the exact command lists enabled, disabled or all known repositories. Lists all enabled reposi‐
              tories by default. Provides more detailed information when [1m-v [22moption is used.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired metadata. See also [4mMetadata[24m [4mSynchronization[24m.

   [1mRepoquery Command[0m
       [1mdnf [options] repoquery [<select-options>] [<query-options>] [<pkg-spec>][0m
              Searches available DNF repositories for selected packages and displays the requested information about them.
              It is an equivalent of [1mrpm -q [22mfor remote repositories.

       [1mdnf [options] repoquery --querytags[0m
              Provides the list of tags recognized by the -[4m-queryformat[24m repoquery option.

              There  are  also  a few specific repoquery commands [1mrepoquery-n[22m, [1mrepoquery-na [22mand [1mrepoquery-nevra [22mthat allow
              the specification of an exact argument in the NEVRA format  (does  not  affect  arguments  of  options  like
              --whatprovides <arg>, ...).

   [1mSelect Options[0m
       Together  with  [1m<pkg-spec>[22m,  control  what packages are displayed in the output. If [1m<pkg-spec> [22mis given, limits the
       resulting set of packages to those matching the specification. All packages are  considered  if  no  [1m<pkg-spec>  [22mis
       specified.

       [1m<pkg-spec>[0m
              Package  specification  in  the NEVRA format (name[-[epoch:]version[-release]][.arch]). See [4mSpecifying[24m [4mPack‐[0m
              [4mages[24m.

       [1m-a, --all[0m
              Query all packages (for rpmquery compatibility, also a shorthand for  repoquery  '*'  or  repoquery  without
              arguments).

       [1m--arch <arch>[,<arch>...], --archlist <arch>[,<arch>...][0m
              Limit  the  resulting set only to packages of selected architectures (default is all architectures). In some
              cases the result is affected by the basearch of the running system, therefore to run repoquery for  an  arch
              incompatible with your system use the [1m--forcearch=<arch> [22moption to change the basearch.

       [1m--duplicates[0m
              Limit  the  resulting  set to installed duplicate packages (i.e. more package versions for the same name and
              architecture). Installonly packages are excluded from this set.

       [1m--unneeded[0m
              Limit the resulting set to leaves packages that were installed as dependencies so they are no longer needed.
              This switch lists packages that are going to be removed after executing the [1mdnf autoremove [22mcommand.

       [1m--available[0m
              Limit the resulting set to available packages only (set by default).

       [1m--extras[0m
              Limit the resulting set to packages that are not present in any of the available repositories.

       [1m-f <file>, --file <file>[0m
              Limit the resulting set only to the package that owns [1m<file>[22m.

       [1m--installed[0m
              Limit  the  resulting  set  to  installed  packages only. The exclude option in the configuration file might
              influence the result, but if the command line  option   -[4m-disableexcludes[24m  is  used,  it  ensures  that  all
              installed packages will be listed.

       [1m--installonly[0m
              Limit the resulting set to installed installonly packages.

       [1m--latest-limit <number>[0m
              Limit the resulting set to <number> of latest packages for every package name and architecture.  If <number>
              is negative, skip <number> of latest packages. For a negative <number> use the [1m--latest-limit=<number>  [22msyn‐
              tax.

       [1m--recent[0m
              Limit the resulting set to packages that were recently edited.

       [1m--repo <repoid>[0m
              Limit  the  resulting  set  only to packages from a repository identified by [1m<repoid>[22m.  Can be used multiple
              times with accumulative effect.

       [1m--unsatisfied[0m
              Report unsatisfied dependencies among installed packages (i.e. missing requires and and existing conflicts).

       [1m--upgrades[0m
              Limit the resulting set to packages that provide an upgrade for some already installed package.

       [1m--userinstalled[0m
              Limit the resulting set to packages installed by the user. The exclude  option  in  the  configuration  file
              might  influence  the result, but if the command line option  -[4m-disableexcludes[24m is used, it ensures that all
              installed packages will be listed.

              advisories  ([1m--list[22m)  or detailed information ([1m--info[22m). When the [1m-v [22moption is used with [1m--info[22m, the informa‐

[1mSPECIFYING PACKAGES[0m
       Many commands take a [1m<package-spec> [22mparameter that selects a package for the operation. DNF looks  for  interpreta‐
       tions of the parameter from the most commonly used meanings to the least, that is it tries to see if the given spec
       fits one of the following patterns (in decreasing order of priority):

       · [1mname.arch[0m

       · [1mname[0m

       · [1mname-[epoch:]version-release.arch[0m

       · [1mname-[epoch:]version-release[0m

       · [1mname-[epoch:]version[0m

       Note that [1mname [22mcan in general contain dashes (e.g. [1mpackage-subpackage[22m).

       Failing to match the input argument to an existing package name based on the patterns above, DNF tries  to  see  if
       the argument matches an existing provide.

       By  default, if multiple versions of the selected package exist in the repository, the most recent version suitable
       for the given operation is used. If the selected package exists for multiple architectures, the packages which best
       match  the  system's  architecture will be preferred. The name specification is case-sensitive, globbing characters
       "[1m?[22m, [1m* [22mand [1m[ [22mare allowed and trigger shell-like glob matching. If a globbing  character  is  present  in  [1mname[22m,  DNF
       expands given [1mname [22mfirst and consequently selects all packages matching the expanded [1m<package-spec>[22m.

       [1m<package-name-spec> [22mis similar to [1m<package-spec> [22mexcept the provides matching is never attempted there.

       [1m<package-installed-specs> [22mis similar to [1m<package-specs> [22mexcept it considers only installed packages.

[1mSPECIFYING EXACT VERSIONS OF PACKAGES[0m
       Commands  accepting  the [1m<package-nevr-spec> [22mparameter need not only the name of the package, but also its version,
       release and optionally the architecture. Further, the version part can be preceded by an epoch when it is  relevant
       (i.e. the epoch is non-zero).

[1mSPECIFYING PROVIDES[0m
       [1m<provide-spec>  [22min  command  descriptions means the command operates on packages providing the given spec. This can
       either be an explicit provide, an implicit provide (i.e. name of the package) or a file provide. The  selection  is
       case-sensitive and globbing is supported.

[1mSPECIFYING GROUPS[0m
       [1m<group-spec> [22mallows one to select (environment) groups a particular operation should work on. It is a case insensi‐
       tive string (supporting globbing characters) that is matched against a group's ID, canonical name and  name  trans‐
       lated into the current LC_MESSAGES locale (if possible).

[1mSPECIFYING MODULES[0m
       [1m<module-spec> [22mallows one to select modules or profiles a particular operation should work on.

       It is in the form of [1mNAME:STREAM:VERSION:CONTEXT:ARCH/PROFILE [22mand supported partial forms are the following:

       · [1mNAME[0m

       · [1mNAME:STREAM[0m

       · [1mNAME:STREAM:VERSION[0m

       · [1mNAME:STREAM:VERSION:CONTEXT[0m

       · all above combinations with [1m::ARCH [22m(e.g. [1mNAME::ARCH[22m)

       · [1mNAME:STREAM:VERSION:CONTEXT:ARCH[0m

       · all above combinations with [1m/PROFILE [22m(e.g. [1mNAME/PROFILE[22m)

       In  case  stream is not specified, the enabled or the default stream is used, in this order. In case profile is not
       specified, the system default profile or the 'default' profile is used.

[1mSPECIFYING TRANSACTIONS[0m
       [1m<transaction-spec> [22mcan be in one of several forms. If it is an integer, it specifies a transaction  ID.  Specifying
       [1mlast  [22mis  the same as specifying the ID of the most recent transaction. The last form is [1mlast-<offset>[22m, where [1m<off‐[0m
       [1mset> [22mis a positive integer. It specifies offset-th transaction preceding the most recent transaction.

[1mMETADATA SYNCHRONIZATION[0m
       Correct operation of DNF depends on having access to up-to-date data from all enabled repositories  but  contacting
       remote mirrors on every operation considerably slows it down and costs bandwidth for both the client and the repos‐
       itory provider. The metadata_expire (see [1mdnf.conf(5)[22m) repository configuration option is used by DNF  to  determine
       whether  a  particular  local  copy  of  repository  data is due to be re-synced. It is crucial that the repository
       providers set the option well, namely to a value where it is guaranteed that if particular metadata  was  available
       in  time  [1mT  [22mon the server, then all packages it references will still be available for download from the server in
       time [1mT + metadata_expire[22m.

       To further reduce the bandwidth load, some of the commands where having up-to-date metadata is not  critical  (e.g.
       the  [1mlist  [22mcommand) do not look at whether a repository is expired and whenever any version of it is locally avail‐
       able to the user's account, it will be used. For non-root use, see also the [1m--cacheonly [22mswitch. Note  that  in  all

       The  updated packages could replace the old modified configuration files with the new ones or keep the older files.
       Neither of the files are actually replaced.  To the conflicting ones RPM gives  additional  suffix  to  the  origin
       name. Which file should maintain the true name after transaction is not controlled by package manager but is speci‐
       fied by each package itself, following packaging guideline.
